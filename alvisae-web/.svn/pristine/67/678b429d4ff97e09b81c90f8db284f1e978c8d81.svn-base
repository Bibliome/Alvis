        "contents": "This strain is a marine gamma-proteobacterium that was isolated from decaying Spartina alterniflora, a salt marsh cord grass. Members of the gammaproteobacterial clade NOR5\/OM60 regularly form an abundant part, up to 11%, of the bacterioplankton community in coastal systems during the summer months. Here, we report the nearly complete genome sequence of one cultured representative, Congregibacter litoralis strain KT71, isolated from North Sea surface water. Unexpectedly, a complete photosynthesis superoperon, including genes for accessory pigments, was discovered. It has a high sequence similarity to BAC clones from Monterey Bay [Beja O, Suzuki MT, Heidelberg JF, Nelson WC, Preston CM, et al. (2002) Nature 415:630-633], which also share a nearly identical gene arrangement. Although cultures of KT71 show no obvious pigmentation, bacteriochlorophyll a and spirilloxanthin-like carotenoids could be detected by HPLC analysis in cell extracts. The presence of two potential BLUF (blue light using flavin adenine dinucleotide sensors), one of which was found adjacent to the photosynthesis operon in the genome, indicates a light- and redox-dependent regulation of gene expression. Like other aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs (AAnPs), KT71 is able to grow neither anaerobically nor photoautotrophically. Cultivation experiments and genomic evidence show that KT71 needs organic substrates like carboxylic acids, oligopeptides, or fatty acids for growth. The strain grows optimally under microaerobic conditions and actively places itself in a zone of approximately 10% oxygen saturation. The genome analysis of C. litoralis strain KT71 identifies the gammaproteobacterial marine AAnPs, postulated based on BAC sequences, as members of the NOR5\/OM60 clade. KT71 enables future experiments investigating the importance of this group of gammaproteobacterial AAnPs in coastal environments. Proteobacteria From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Proteobacteria The Proteobacteria are a major group (phylum) of bacteria. They include a wide variety of pathogens, such as Escherichia, Salmonella, Vibrio, Helicobacter, and many other notable genera. [2] Others are free-living, and include many of the bacteria responsible for nitrogen fixation. Because of the great diversity of forms found in this group, the Proteobacteria are named after Proteus, a Greek god of the sea, capable of assuming many different shapes.[1] [3] All proteobacteria are Gram-negative, with an outer membrane mainly composed of lipopolysaccharides. Many move about using flagella, but some are non-motile or rely on bacterial gliding. The last include the myxobacteria, a unique group of bacteria that can aggregate to form multicellular fruiting bodies. There is also a wide variety in the types of metabolism. Most members are facultatively or obligately anaerobic, chemoautotrophs, and heterotrophic, but there are numerous exceptions. A variety of genera, which are not closely related to each other, convert energy from light through photosynthesis. These are called purple bacteria, referring to their mostly reddish pigmentation. Phylogeny of proteobacteria according to ARB living tree, iTOL, Bergey's and others. The group is defined primarily in terms of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences. The Proteobacteria are divided into six sections, referred to by the Greek letters alpha through zeta, again based on rRNA sequences. These are often treated as classes. The alpha, beta, delta, elpsilon sections are monophiletic[4][5][6], bar the Gammaproteobacteria due to the Acidithiobacillus genus is paraphyletic to betaproteobacteria, according to multigenome alignement studies, which if done correctly are more precise than 16S[7] (note that Mariprofundus ferrooxydans sole member of the Zetaproteobacteria[8] was previously missclassified on NCBI taxonomy). Acidithiobacillus contains 5 species and the sole genus in its order Acidithiobacillales[9] Although it has been suggested previously that the Gammaproteobacteria are paraphyletic to the Betaproteobacteria, recent molecular data suggest this is not so. The divisions of the proteobacteria were once regarded as subclasses (e.g. Î±-subclass of the Proteobacteria), but are now regarded as classes (e.g. the Alphaproteobacteria).[10].",
