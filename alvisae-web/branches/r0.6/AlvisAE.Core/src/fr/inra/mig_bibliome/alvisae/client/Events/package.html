    This package contains all the application specific events published on the global eventBus.
    <br/>
    UI Components are loosely coupled one to another, the Event bus should be the sole link.
    <p/>
    Typically, a new event is fired (=published on the eventBus) as a result of a specific user action.
    <br/>
    Then, components which should be updated after such actions need to implement the corresponding EventHandler (and register it to the eventBus).
    <br/>
    Since the application flow is both way, they might as well fire new events on the Bus.
