# The Alvis suite

The Alvis suite is a text-mining and knowledge management suite, in use in scientific laboratories.

The Alvis suite has dedicated components:

- [AlvisNLP](https://github.com/bibliome/alvisnlp), an automatic corpus processing engine that features a library with more than 50 processing modules: tokenization, POS-tagging, parsing, NER, machine-learning, etc.)

- [AlvisAE](https://github.com/bibliome/alvisae), an annotation editor for building training corpora for NER, entity normalization and relation extraction.

- [AlvisIR](https://github.com/bibliome/alvisae), a semantic search engine builder.

Alvis is developped by the [Bibliome team](http://maiage.jouy.inra.fr/?q=fr/bibliome/) at the French National Institute for Agriculture Research (INRA).

## Development stage

The Alvis suite is in beta stage but stable enough to be used in production.

The Alvis suite is part of [OpenMinTeD](https://openminted.eu) (H2020 EINFRA project) plateform. The roadmap includes a full integration of AlvisNLP, AlvisAE, and AlvisIR as components of OpenMinTeD.
