# The Alvis suite

The Alvis suite is a text-mining and knowledge management suite, in use in scientific laboratories.

The Alvis suite has dedicated components:

- [AlvisNLP](https://bibliome.github.io/alvisnlp/), an automatic corpus processing engine that features a library with more than 50 processing modules: tokenization, POS-tagging, parsing, NER, machine-learning, etc.

- [AlvisAE](https://github.com/Bibliome/alvisae), an annotation editor for building training corpora for NER, entity normalization and relation extraction.

- [AlvisIR](https://github.com/bibliome/alvisir), a semantic search engine builder.

- [TyDI](https://forgemia.inra.fr/bibliome/tydi), a terminology and ontology editor.

Alvis is developped by the [Bibliome team](https://maiage.mathnum.inrae.fr/en/bibliome) at the French National Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment ([INRAE](https://www.inrae.fr/en)).
