# The Alvis suite

The Alvis suite is a text-mining and knowledge management suite, in use in scientific laboratories.

The Alvis suite has dedicated components:

- [AlvisNLP](https://github.com/bibliome/alvisnlp), an automatic corpus processing engine that features a library with more than 50 processing modules: tokenization, POS-tagging, parsing, NER, machine-learning, etc.)

- [AlvisAE](https://github.com/bibliome/alvisae), an annotation editor for building training corpora for NER, entity normalization and relation extraction.

- [AlvisIR](https://github.com/bibliome/alvisae), a semantic search engine builder.

Alvis is developped by the [Bibliome team](http://maiage.jouy.inra.fr/?q=fr/bibliome/) at the French National Institute for Agriculture Research (INRA).

## Development stage

The Alvis suite is in beta stage but stable enough to be used in production.

The Alvis suite is part of [OpenMinTeD](https://openminted.eu) plateform. The roadmap includes a full integration of AlvisNLP, AlvisAE, and AlvisIR as components of OpenMinTeD.


## OpenMinTeD

The [OpenMinTeD](https://openminted.eu) project is a EINRA H2020 project that aims to provide a text-mining plateform to non-expert academics.
OpenMinTeD will allow easy use of text-mining tools and easy exploitation of results obtained by text-mining.

Several teams from european countries united around this project and the available expertise encompasses computer science (text-mining, database management, indexing), computational biology (bioinformatics), publishing (Open Access editors, digital libraries), humanities (social sciences, digital humanities).

OpenMinTeD will run on top of the [Galaxy](http://galaxyproject.org/) workflow engine. The integration of existing text-mining tools as Galaxy components is under progress.
The OpenMinTeD also seeks to contribute to the Galaxy framework (Tool Shed, workflow engine) to enable the close integration between text-mining projects and domain-specific data processing services for bioinformatics, life sciences, and social sciences.


## Text mining

Text mining is a mature discipline that aims to extract high-quality and structured information from heterogeneous and unstructured resources. Current developments make use of Natural Language Processing techniques and Machine Learning algorithms to automatize the Information Extraction (IE).
The current trend of text-mining methods makes extensive use of shared resources like terminologies and ontologies.
The gap between text-mining and the Linked Data communities is narrowing!


## Text-mining on scientific publications is legal in France since 2016

[Since October 2016](https://via.hypothes.is/http://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/cid107077/les-chercheurs-francais-pourront-desormais-pratiquer-pleinement-la-fouille-de-texte-et-de-donnees.html), the "Loi pour une République numérique" was enacted: French researchers are entitled to perform text-mining on scientific publications.
Text-mining researchers are also entitled to this right in Great Britain [since 2014](https://scinfolex.com/2014/04/01/le-royaume-uni-sanctuarise-les-pratiques-de-data-mining-par-le-biais-dune-exception-au-droit-dauteur/) and in the United States [since 2015](https://scinfolex.com/2015/10/21/comment-laffaire-google-books-se-termine-en-victoire-pour-le-text-mining/).

Text-mining has been mature for years, so the development of the OpenMinTeD plateform is intended to make text-mining available to non-experts.

Recherche d'un dev :

- Java : il y a du code Java
- du design (légèrement mais être futé est attendu), au dev (fusion de deux suites), intégration au niveau de la plateforme OpenMinTeD (Galaxy), un petit peu de production
- objectif qualité : tests, intégration continue

Deux missions :
- intégrer AlvisAE et AlvisNLP
- intégrer la suite Alvis à la plateforme OpenMinTeD (basée sur le moteur de workflows Galaxy)

Proximité (discussions, séminaires, éventuellement contribution à) : Text Mining, Workflows, Machine Learning, promotion de l'Open Access en sciences
